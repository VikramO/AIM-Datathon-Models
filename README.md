# AIM-Datathon-Patient-Survival-Prediction-Model
This repository outlines my code for a machine learning model I built for a university competition, in which the goal was to predict survival in cancer patients. We also had to present potential use cases for our models, for which I built a model that can classify cancer stage progression, since one of the panelists, a medical doctor, stated that prior knowledge of cancer state progression could have saved his father.
I achieved 1st case in potential use cases and 2nd place in accuracy.
